# Learn Javascript patterns with minimal coding

This project has architecture design patterns implemented using Javascript ES6+. However, its a minimal representation of the implementation (mostly console log output)

> I use python simpleserver (Python Version 2+) to quickly run the project. 
command: python -m SimpleHTTPServer
I change the js file reference in index.html to run the respective pattern. But you can use any webserver to run it.
